# Tips

### LaTeX extensions
I use LaTeX Workshop + LaTeX Utilities extensions for building pdfs

### Word Wrap
In VS Code, go to "Preferences: Configure Language Specific Settings". Turn on "Word Wrap" to wrap line at 80 characters for better viewing experience for languages "TeX" and "LaTeX".

### Errors
Turn off compile error messages in LaTeX Workshop, they are too frequent and annoying.
